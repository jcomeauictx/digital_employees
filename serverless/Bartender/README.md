### Function Fillers

A function filler is triggered when a specific function is executed. In this example, it specifies what happens when the function is called. The filler text can be customized to create a more personalized interaction with the end user. If defined, this custom filler will override the default filler array, making the interaction more dynamic and engaging.

```json
                "function": "get_vector_data",
                "fillers": {
                  "en-US": [
                    "This is the get vector data function firing"
                  ]
                },
```
