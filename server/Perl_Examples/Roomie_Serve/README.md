# Roomie Serve

Roomie Serve structures data efficiently using metadata tables in the AI Agent to avoid SQL latency. Every piece of information used by the app is systematically stored within these tables, from menu specifics to SKUs and pricing.

Shopping cart functionality is also integrated in the metadata framework, serving as a temporary data repository while the AI Agent is active. This innovative approach drastically reduces the need for direct database interactions, significantly enhancing response times and the smoothness of interactions with the AI.
