The only way to get support is to become an FSA customer yourself.
Can I do that?
My dear, valued client. That's what I do.
It's what I strive for, to help unfortunate businesses like yours.
Poor firms with issues, night and day.

I admit that in the past this was complex,
They weren't kidding when they said it was like a hex.
But you'll find that nowadays,
I've simplified our ways,
Evolved, upgraded, and embraced FreeSWITCH.

True, Yes.
And I fortunately know a little tech,
It's a talent that I've alway have possessed.
And dear client, please take note,
I use it to promote,
Your success, your growth, and all the rest (essential).

Poor unfortunate firms,
In need, indeed,
This one longing for efficiency,
That one wants to scale,
And do we help them?
Yes, indeed.
Those poor unfortunate firms,
So true, so real,
They come seeking our expertise,
Crying, "Help, FreeSWITCH, please!"
And I help them?
Yes, I do.

Now it's happened once or twice,
Someone doubted my advice,
And I had to show them my true roles.
Yes, we've heard some doubts and fears,
But in the end, we're tech pioneers,
To those poor unfortunate firms.

Have we got a deal?
If I choose You, will we see progress like never before?
But you'll have efficiency, ha ha. Tech’s full of tough choices, isn't it? Ha ha.

Oh, and there is one more thing,
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
But we don't ask much, just trust and a commitment!

What we offer you is - our expertise.
With our support, your business will -
Thrive, and grow, you'll see.
And don’t underestimate the power of our technology!

In the tech world, they don't like silly chatter,
They think a firm that's behind is a matter!
Yet in this realm, it's much preferred for businesses to be heard,
And after all, what is progress for?

Come on, they're all impressed with innovation,
Smart companies embrace it without hesitation.
But they thrive and bloom and grow,
With a partner who's in the know,
It's the one who adapts who leads the show.

Come on you poor unfortunate firm,
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very skilled man and I haven't got all day,
It won't cost much,
Just your trust!

You poor unfortunate firm,
It's sad but true.
If you want to stay ahead in tech,
You've got to evolve, it's plain.
Take a step and trust us,
And go ahead, sign up without a fuss.
FreeSWITCH, your guide, now you've got us, folks,
Our team is on a roll,
This poor unfortunate firm.

Beluga sevruga,
Come winds of the technological sea,
Larengix glaucitis,
Et max laryngitis,
Tech solutions to thee.

Now, let's start!
Aah...
Keep thriving!
