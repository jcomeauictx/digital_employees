### Exploring the Interactive Features of Bobby's Table Website

Welcome to our deep dive into the interactive features of the "Bobby's Table" website. This site offers a unique and user-friendly way for customers to manage their dining reservations. Let's break down the key components of the website and understand how they enhance the user experience.
Understanding the HTML Structure

### The website is built with a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and template tags. Its main components include:

* Header Section: This contains the restaurant's logo, slogan, and contact information.
* Reservation Update System: A multi-step form that allows customers to update their reservations.


### Interactive Features

The site's interactivity is powered by form inputs and links, allowing customers to easily update or cancel their reservations. Here's how it works:

#### Step 1: Verifying the Reservation

Customers begin by entering the phone number under which the reservation was made. This step is crucial for identifying the specific reservation to be updated.

```html

<form action="/update" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="customer_phone">
  <input type="submit" value="Next">
</form>

```

#### Step 2: Security Verification

In the second step, customers are asked to input a verification code (SignalWire MFA api) sent to their phone. This enhances security by ensuring that only the person who made the reservation can modify it.

#### Step 3: Updating Reservation Details

Finally, customers can update their reservation details, such as the name on the reservation, the number of people, and the date and time. They can also choose to cancel the reservation in this step.

```html

<form action="/update" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="customer_name">
  <input type="date" name="reservation_date">
  <!-- Additional fields -->
  <input type="submit" value="Update">
</form>

```

### Footer Section

The footer provides additional contact information and links to partner services like DineDash, MealZoom, and RapidFeast.
Enhancing User Experience

The website's design focuses on ease of use. The clear, step-by-step process for reservation management makes it straightforward for users to modify their plans. The use of forms and validation ensures that the information is accurate and secure.

#### Key Takeaways

* User-Friendly Design: The website's layout and step-by-step process make it easy for customers to interact with the site.
* Security: Verification steps add an extra layer of security to the reservation process.
